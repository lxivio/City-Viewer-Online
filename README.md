Project Goal: Procedurally generate Cube City with manhattan style skyscrapers, roads, cars, stoplights, and helicopters.

Uses MVC controller pattern. Dynamically set city attributes such as number of blocks in X, Z. Size of city blocks in X, Z. Avg number of Helicopters per block, Avg number of super sky scrapers per block, etc. Stop light and car interactions all with waiting coroutines, no OnUpdate functions like to see if the stoplight turns green. Switch between different camera views to see the city or follow around helicopters or cars.
